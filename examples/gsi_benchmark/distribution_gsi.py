    # The matched Twiss functions below are obtained from running gsi.madx using MAD-X.
    # These values agree with the values reported here:
    #    https://web-docs.gsi.de/~giuliano/research_activity/trapping_benchmarking/twiss-sis18,
    # except for the horizontal dispersion and its derivative, which are reported as
    # (Dx,Dx') = (1.946,-0.325).  Those values differ from the values obtained in MAD-X
    # due to the convention of using pt vs delta as the canonical momentum.  Our dispersion
    # convention is consistent with that used in MAD-X.
