Parameters: Python
==================

This documents on how to use ImpactX as a Python script (``python3 run_script.py``).

Collective Effects & Overall Simulation Parameters
--------------------------------------------------

.. py:class:: impactx.ImpactX

   This is the central simulation class.

   .. py:property:: particle_shape

      Control the particle B-spline order.

      The order of the shape factors (splines) for the macro-particles along all spatial directions: `1` for linear, `2` for quadratic, `3` for cubic.
      Low-order shape factors result in faster simulations, but may lead to more noisy results.
      High-order shape factors are computationally more expensive, but may increase the overall accuracy of the results.
      For production runs it is generally safer to use high-order shape factors, such as cubic order.

      :param int order: B-spline order ``1``, ``2``, or ``3``

   .. py:property:: n_cell

      The number of grid points along each direction on the coarsest level.

   .. py:property:: max_level

      The maximum mesh-refinement level for the simulation.

   .. py:property:: finest_level

      The currently finest level of mesh-refinement used.
      This is always less or equal to :py:attr:`~max_level`.

   .. py:property:: domain

      The physical extent of the full simulation domain, relative to the reference particle position, in meters.
      When set, turns ``dynamic_size`` to ``False``.

      Note: particles that move outside the simulation domain are removed.

   .. py:property:: prob_relative

      This is a list with ``amr.max_level`` + 1 entries.

      By default, we dynamically extract the minimum and maximum of the particle positions in the beam.
      The field mesh spans, per direction, multiple times the maximum physical extent of beam particles, as given by this factor.
      The beam minimum and maximum extent are symmetrically padded by the mesh.
      For instance, ``1.2`` means the mesh will span 10% above and 10% below the beam;
      ``1.0`` means the beam is exactly covered with the mesh.

      Default: ``[3.0 1.0 1.0 ...]``.
      When set, turns ``dynamic_size`` to ``True``.

   .. py:property:: dynamic_size

      Use dynamic (``True``) resizing of the field mesh or static sizing (``False``).

   .. py:property:: space_charge

      Enable (``True``) or disable (``False``) space charge calculations (default: ``False``).

      Whether to calculate space charge effects.

   .. py:property:: poisson_solver

      The numerical solver to solve the Poisson equation when calculating space charge effects.
      Either ``"multigrid"`` (default) or ``"fft"``.

      Currently, this is a 3D solver.
      An additional `2D/2.5D solver <https://github.com/ECP-WarpX/impactx/issues/401>`__ will be added in the near future.

      * ``fft``: Poisson's equation is solved using an Integrated Green Function method (which requires FFT calculations).
        See these references for more details `Qiang et al. (2006) <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.9.044204>`__ (+ `Erratum <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.10.129901>`__).
        This requires the compilation flag ``-DImpactX_FFT=ON``.
        If mesh refinement (MR) is enabled, this FFT solver is used only on the coarsest level and a multi-grid solver is used on refined levels.
        The boundary conditions are assumed to be open.

      * ``multigrid``: Poisson's equation is solved using an iterative multigrid (MLMG) solver.
        See the `AMReX documentation <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/LinearSolvers.html#>`__ for details of the MLMG solver.

   .. py:property:: mlmg_relative_tolerance

      Default: ``1.e-7``

      The relative precision with which the electrostatic space-charge fields should be calculated.
      More specifically, the space-charge fields are computed with an iterative Multi-Level Multi-Grid (MLMG) solver.
      This solver can fail to reach the default precision within a reasonable time.

   .. py:property:: mlmg_absolute_tolerance

      Default: ``0``, which means: ignored

      The absolute tolerance with which the space-charge fields should be calculated in units of :math:`V/m^2`.
      More specifically, the acceptable residual with which the solution can be considered converged.
      In general this should be left as the default, but in cases where the simulation state changes very
      little between steps it can occur that the initial guess for the MLMG solver is so close to the
      converged value that it fails to improve that solution sufficiently to reach the ``mlmg_relative_tolerance`` value.

   .. py:property:: mlmg_max_iters

      Default: ``100``

      Maximum number of iterations used for MLMG solver for space-charge fields calculation.
      In case if MLMG converges but fails to reach the desired self_fields_required_precision, this parameter may be increased.

   .. py:property:: mlmg_verbosity

      Default: ``1``

      The verbosity used for MLMG solver for space-charge fields calculation.
      Currently MLMG solver looks for verbosity levels from 0-5.
      A higher number results in more verbose output.

   .. py:property:: csr

      Enable (``True``) or disable (``False``) space charge calculations (default: ``False``).

      Whether to calculate Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) effects (default: disabled).
      Currently, this is the 1D ultrarelativistic steady-state wakefield model (eq. 19 of
      `E. L. Saldin et al, NIMA 398, p. 373-394 (1997), DOI:10.1016/S0168-9002(97)00822-X <https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-9002(97)00822-X>`__).

      .. note::

         CSR effects are only calculated for lattice elements that include bending, such as ``Sbend``, ``ExactSbend`` and ``CFbend``.

         CSR effects require the compilation flag ``-DImpactX_FFT=ON``.

   .. py:property:: csr_bins

      Enable or disable Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) calculations (default: ``150``).

   .. py:property:: diagnostics

      Enable (``True``) or disable (``False``) diagnostics generally (default: ``True``).
      Disabling this is mostly used for benchmarking.

   .. py:property:: slice_step_diagnostics

      Enable (``True``) or disable (``False``) diagnostics every slice step in elements  (default: ``True``).

      By default, diagnostics is performed at the beginning and end of the simulation.
      Enabling this flag will write diagnostics every step and slice step.

   .. py:property:: diag_file_min_digits

      The minimum number of digits (default: ``6``) used for the step
      number appended to the diagnostic file names.

   .. py:property:: particle_lost_diagnostics_backend

      Diagnostics for particles lost in apertures.
      See the ``BeamMonitor`` element for backend values.

   .. py:property:: eigenemittances

      Enable (``True``) or disable (``False``) output of eigenemittances at every slice step in elements  (default: ``False``).

      If this flag is enabled, the 3 eigenemittances of the 6D beam distribution are computed and written as diagnostics.
      This flag is disabled by default to reduce computational cost.

   .. py:method:: init_grids()

      Initialize AMReX blocks/grids for domain decomposition & space charge mesh.

      This must come first, before particle beams and lattice elements are initialized.

   .. py:method:: add_particles(charge_C, distr, npart)

      Particle tracking mode: Generate and add n particles to the particle container.
      Note: Set the reference particle properties (charge, mass, energy) first.

      Will also resize the geometry based on the updated particle distribution's extent and then redistribute particles in according AMReX grid boxes.

      Access the beam particle container (:py:class:`impactx.ParticleContainer`).

   .. py:property:: lattice

      Access the elements in the accelerator lattice.
      See :py:mod:`impactx.elements` for lattice elements.

   .. py:property:: periods

      The number of periods to repeat the lattice.

   .. py:property:: abort_on_warning_threshold

      (optional) Set to "low", "medium" or "high".
      Cause the code to abort if a warning is raised that exceeds the warning threshold.

   .. py:property:: abort_on_unused_inputs

      Set to ``1`` to cause the simulation to fail *after* its completion if there were unused parameters. (default: ``0`` for false)
      It is mainly intended for continuous integration and automated testing to check that all tests and inputs are adapted to API changes.

   .. py:property:: always_warn_immediately

      If set to ``1``, ImpactX immediately prints every warning message as soon as it is generated. (default: ``0`` for false)
      It is mainly intended for debug purposes, in case a simulation crashes before a global warning report can be printed.

   .. py:property:: verbose

      Controls how much information is printed to the terminal, when running ImpactX.
      ``0`` for silent, higher is more verbose. Default is ``1``.

   .. py:method:: evolve()

   .. py:method:: track_particles()

      Run the particle tracking simulation loop.

   .. py:method:: track_envelope()

   .. py:property:: have_mpi

      Indicates multi-process/multi-node support via the `message-passing interface (MPI) <https://www.mpi-forum.org>`__.
      Possible values: ``True``/``False``

      .. note::

         Particle beam particles are not yet dynamically load balanced.
         Please see the progress in `issue 198 <https://github.com/ECP-WarpX/impactx/issues/198>`__.

   .. py:property:: have_gpu

      Indicates GPU support.
      Possible values: ``True``/``False``

   .. py:property:: gpu_backend

   .. py:property:: have_omp

      Indicates multi-threaded CPU support via `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org>`__.
      Possible values: ``True``/``False```

      Set the environment variable ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` to control the number of threads.

      .. warning::

         By default, OpenMP spawns as many threads as there are available physical CPU cores on a host.
         When MPI and OpenMP support are used at the same time, it can easily happen that one over-subscribes the available physical CPU cores.
         This will lead to a severe slow-down of the simulation.

         By setting appropriate `environment variables for OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/spec-html/5.0/openmpch6.html>`__, ensure that the number of MPI processes (ranks) per node multiplied with the number of OpenMP threads is equal to the number of physical (or virtual) CPU cores.
         Please see our examples in the :ref:`high-performance computing (HPC) <install-hpc>` on how to run efficiently in parallel environments such as supercomputers.

   The matrix :math:`R` multiplies the phase space vector :math:`(x,px,y,py,t,pt)`, where coordinates :math:`(x,y,t)` have units of m
   and momenta :math:`(px,py,pt)` are dimensionless.  So, for example, :math:`R(1,1)` is dimensionless, and :math:`R(1,2)` has units of m.

   The internal tracking methods used by ImpactX are symplectic.  However, if a user-defined linear map :math:`R` is provided, it is
   up to the user to ensure that the matrix :math:`R` is symplectic.  Otherwise, this condition may be violated.

   :param ds: length associated with a user-defined linear element (defaults to 0), in m

   The `I/O backend <https://openpmd-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/overview.html>`_ for `openPMD <https://www.openPMD.org>`_ data dumps.
   ``bp`` is the `ADIOS2 I/O library <https://csmd.ornl.gov/adios>`_, ``h5`` is the `HDF5 format <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/>`_, and ``json`` is a `simple text format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_.
   ``json`` only works with serial/single-rank jobs.
   By default, the first available backend in the order given above is taken.

   openPMD `iteration encoding <https://openpmd-api.readthedocs.io/en/0.14.0/usage/concepts.html#iteration-and-series>`__ determines if multiple files are created for individual output steps or not.
