Expanding Beam in Free Space
============================

A coasting bunch expanding freely in free space under its own space charge.

We use a cold (zero emittance) 250 MeV electron bunch whose
initial distribution is a uniformly-populated 3D ball of radius R0 = 1 mm when viewed in the bunch rest
frame.

In the laboratory frame, the bunch is a uniformly-populated ellipsoid, which
expands to twice its original size.  This is tested using the second moments of the distribution.

In this test, the initial and final values of :math:`\sigma_x`, :math:`\sigma_y`, :math:`\sigma_t`, :math:`\epsilon_x`, :math:`\epsilon_y`, and :math:`\epsilon_t` must agree with nominal values.

This test uses mesh-refinement to solve the space charge force.
The coarse grid wraps the beam maximum extent by 300%, emulating "open boundary" conditions.
The refined grid in level 1 spans 110% of the beam maximum extent.
The grid spacing is adaptively adjusted as the beam evolves.


Run
---

This example can be run **either** as:

* **Python** script: ``python3 run_expanding_fft.py`` or
* ImpactX **executable** using an input file: ``impactx input_expanding_fft.in``

For `MPI-parallel <https://www.mpi-forum.org>`__ runs, prefix these lines with ``mpiexec -n 4 ...`` or ``srun -n 4 ...``, depending on the system.

We also provide the same example with the multi-grid (MLMG) Poisson solver.
