.. _install-conda:

Using the Conda-Forge Package
-----------------------------

A package for ImpactX is available via `Conda-Forge <https://conda-forge.org/download/>`__.

.. tip::

   We recommend to deactivate that conda self-activates its ``base`` environment.
   This `avoids interference with the system and other package managers <https://collegeville.github.io/CW20/WorkshopResources/WhitePapers/huebl-working-with-multiple-pkg-mgrs.pdf>`__.

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda config --set auto_activate_base false

   In order to make sure that the conda configuration uses ``conda-forge`` as the only channel, which will help avoid issues with blocked ``defaults`` or ``anaconda`` repositories, please set the following configurations:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda config --add channels conda-forge
      conda config --set channel_priority strict

.. code-block:: bash

   mamba create -n impactx -c conda-forge impactx
   mamba activate impactx

.. note::

   The ``impactx`` package on conda-forge does not yet provide `GPU support <https://github.com/conda-forge/impactx-feedstock/issues/4>`__.

From Source with CMake
----------------------

After installing the :ref:`ImpactX dependencies <install-dependencies>`, you can also install ImpactX from source with `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   # get the source code
   git clone https://github.com/ECP-WarpX/impactx.git $HOME/src/impactx
   cd $HOME/src/impactx

   # configure
   cmake -S . -B build

   # optional: change configuration
   ccmake build

   # compile
   #   on Windows:          --config Release
   cmake --build build -j 4

   # executables for ImpactX are now in build/bin/

We document the details in the :ref:`developer installation <install-developers>`.

Tips for macOS Users
--------------------

.. tip::

   Before getting started with package managers, please check what you manually installed in ``/usr/local``.
   If you find entries in ``bin/``, ``lib/`` et al. that look like you manually installed MPI, HDF5 or other software in the past, then remove those files first.

   If you find software such as MPI in the same directories that are shown as symbolic links then it is likely you `brew installed <https://brew.sh/>`__ software before.
   If you are trying annother package manager than ``brew``, run `brew unlink ... <https://docs.brew.sh/Tips-N%27-Tricks#quickly-remove-something-from-usrlocal>`__ on such packages first to avoid software incompatibilities.
