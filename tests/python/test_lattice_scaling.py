"""Lattice operations stay linear in the number of elements.

A long beamline -- a ring, or anything that has been through
``insert_element_every_ds`` -- has many thousands of elements. An operation that moves
the tail of the lattice once per position is quadratic, which is unnoticeable in a unit
test and ruinous at scale. These tests compare the cost at two sizes rather than a wall
time, so they mean the same thing on any machine.

Timing on a shared build machine is noisy, so the two sizes are far apart: growing the
lattice fourfold costs a linear operation 4x and a quadratic one 16x. Judging against 8
therefore leaves a factor of two of headroom on either side. Comparing neighbouring
sizes would leave only the span from 2 to 4, which noise alone can cover.
