ImpactX
-------

ImpactX enables high-performance modeling of beam dynamics in particle accelerators with collective effects.

This is the next generation of the `IMPACT-Z <https://github.com/impact-lbl/IMPACT-Z>`__ code.
ImpactX runs on modern GPUs or CPUs alike, provides user-friendly interfaces suitable for AI/ML workflows, has many :ref:`benchmarks <usage-examples>` to ensure its correctness, and an extensive documentation.

As a beam dynamics code, ImpactX uses the reference trajectory path length :math:`s` as the independent variable of motion to achieve large speedups.
The code includes the effects of externally applied fields from magnets and accelerating cavities as well as the effect of self-fields (space charge fields, CSR, wakefields, ...).
All particle tracking models are symplectic, and space charge is included by solving the Poisson equation in the beam rest frame.
The code may be used to model the dynamics of beams in both linear and ring accelerators.
See our :ref:`theory chapter <theory-concepts>` for details on our models, assumptions and concepts.

ImpactX is part of the `Beam, Plasma & Accelerator Simulation Toolkit (BLAST) <https://blast.lbl.gov>`__.
Please see this page for more information to select the code most appropriate for your application.
